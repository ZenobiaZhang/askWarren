2018-04-20,"PWA based on phone/tablet possiblyThat's what I was thinking. The feel of the mac 2016 one note really makes me think of the UWA version already. To run itThere’s office for Mac which includes Onenote for Mac as wellYesDoes this mean it will only be available from their app store?So don't distribute them through the MS Store?? You do know that UWP != Microsoft StoreI actually didn't.UWP apps don't have to be distributed via Microsoft Store.I actually didn't know number two. I thought they had to be installed through the Microsoft Store. This actually does change things from my point of view.YepSee. Education.NoYou must be kidding... Steve Ballmer is the one that grew MS into a huge tech company. Look at historical revenue and profit under his watch.YesLet's see how Satya does in the next 10-15 years to know before making grand statements like this.I think he will do amazing.RemindMe! 3650 days ""Did Satya Nadella Save Microsoft?""MS has clearly and transparently stated that UWP is their new platform API.Either switch platformsGreat. From windows to Mac"
2018-04-21,I'd you are who you claim to be then why the hell would you ask them to stop pushing UWP?OhThat just demonstrates that you don't know what UWP is. You can design a UWP app that focuses on mouse and keyboard.Have you really used UWP?As a user yesThere won't be a future for Microsoft if they continue to try to push what customers don't want. Balmer tried that for years and failed. The only reason Microsoft is still successful is because of Satya Nadella.EDIT: And I'm surprised this is happening under his watch.NO GOD PLEASE NO!OH GOD THE HORROR
2018-04-22,OneNote is one of the best office appsSTOP PUSHING UWP APPS! EDIT: FULL DISCLOSURE: I am a .NET Software Engineer & Love Microsoft
2018-04-23,WTF nooooo!
2018-04-24,Because Desktop (READ: FAT CLIENT APPLICATIONS) are not going away
2018-05-01,Web is evolving 10 times faster than desktop and 3 times faster than mobile.OneNote has been WPF app for nearly 15 years. They've added featuresFor certain types of enterprises... this is going to suck donkey balls.Certain type of enterprise can still use OneNote 2016.Some are still on 2010....That's been 8 years ago. You have to move on eventually.
2018-05-02,The biggest gripe for me is pushing to web based applications that used to reside on the desktop. Vsphere only has a web app in their new versions. Its awful. Absolutely awful. Every computer has to open up in a new browser tab.So
2018-05-03,It’s more “security”being scared to embrace a private cloud for me
2018-05-04,We are not discussing here a local cache copy. The UWP OneNote cannot open local notes. If you go to More Notebooks... option you can only open them from OneDrive. There is just one option to add notebooks. Add a Microsoft account. How is that offline in your book?The only reason I have my local notes in the UWP version is that I added them from the desktop version before and they are already in sync. In factAs someone who relies on exporting PDF (note taker)I'm guessing Windows 10 version means the Windows store version? I hope it retains most of the features from the desktop app. And provides easy conversion from the desktop notebooks. I use OneNote regularly so I'd hate to see it lose functionalityOn the other hand if this means it's essentially free for everyone that seems like a nice change.This is concerning. Last time I tired to use the UWP versionNot all. Saw a win95 machine yesterday. I wept at my deskLink for the LazyThis isn't affecting Mac
2018-05-05,YeahYou picked an arbitrary point on the timeline of Microsoft web technologies.Front Page -> Classic ASP -> Web Forms -> MVC -> Core -> BlazorJust because MVC has been around for a while does not mean that it's safe from being replaced.For the certain type that has a client engineering team that think they're still managing XP.Web is evolving 10 times faster than desktop and 3 times faster than mobile.[citation needed]
2018-05-07,ThanksHe is rightHow do you mean it can't handle screen clipping? I paste stuff from Snipping Tool all the time.Yeah. I think the major downside to the conversion will have to be a) the loss of add-ins and b) the loss of being able to use offline workbooks.This move forces the use of OnedriveOur entire team shares a one note with tons of pages and folders. The W10 app will no open it as we keep it up on a sharepoint. Already lost us as a user of the W10 app.
2018-05-08,As they've saidSince it is a windows 10 appOneDrive is HIPAA compliant. https://www.hipaaguide.net/onedrive-hipaa-compliant/MS is moving rapidly into the health care industry with their products.I used to consult for the government in healthcare especially related to the prison system :) And MS (as well as Oracle) have almost their entire product portfolio HIPAA compliant.So yesI will certainly pass this along to my bossesActually 2025 :)How is this going to work for offline notes? The UWP OneNote is a severe downgrade and can't even do half of what the desktop version can.And no MicrosoftCore is a new framework that runs MVC
2018-05-11,I'm confused.. What will happen to the desktop app?And what about our notebooks?I use onenote becuase of the syncing and the encryption on the sections.I really hope all those features will be availableOnenote 2016 will also still be getting security updates for like 8 more years. Even when it stopsI find the Windows 10 app superior at this point already.It's pretty good but isn't it still missing many advanced features?It doesn't support local notebook or exporting notebooks as files (backup)Ink to Text should be available in your OneNote appThanks for replying and passing on the message :)As for your questionThis is exactly how I use the desktop version. Some notes are on OneDriveI don't see how they plan to market OneNote/Office 2019 for companies if they kill those features. My OneNote data is essentialYesWindows + shift + s. I noticed I said ctrlYou sure you're talking about the windows 10 app? I have it open and that command isn't doing anythingTry Windows+Shift+S
2018-05-12,Onenote 2016 will continue working as normal but there won’t be a new Onenote 2019 (though there is a new Word excel ppt 2019)Thing that boggles my mind is the desktop version has ink to text but not the math solver functionyea thats what I do as well
2018-05-13,Not sure what you are talking about... UWP OneNote puts a local copy on your drive... you don't have to be online always.Also
2018-05-15,I don't know their plans in this area but I have passed your comment along to a product manager for OneNote. When you say automatically fits to the width of the page
2018-06-08,"Yeah it was fun... Had several projects grind to a halt due to competing interests there. Oddly I found industries like financial services were schizophrenic in their views.In the 90sMaybe it was their ownUsing SCO might easily turn anyone away from liking a Unix system ever again. Suddenly it all makes so much sense.In the 90sext4 filesystem support in WindowsThe thing is that Microsoft left Hotmail on Linux servers for years after they acquired them. AlsoCare to elaborate how sudo is more efficient? Genuinely curious.Using a mouse is less efficient.Actions speak louder than words:1. Microsoft Released Its Own Linux Distribution2. Microsoft Ships Linux Distros in the Windows Store3. Microsoft Now Designs Software for Linux4. Microsoft Contributes to the Linux Kernel5. Microsoft Is a Member of the Linux Foundation6. Microsoft Developers Make Linux-Related VideosWell the largest sign is how much they seemingly want to drive me to ditch windows and switch over fully and finally.Noif you use any kind of mail programm for it yesI hate when they say ""the most powerful [product name] yet"". If they make another one next yearFor those times when you need a laptop that screams ""I am 14 years old!""Why do PC manufacturers insist on making such embarrassingly dumb looking machines? These are the laptop equivalent of a Subaru with a giant spoiler and rice pipes.This is why I've always liked the more recent Alienware laptops. They just look... subtleEven Razer is moving away from the ‘L33T Gamerz’ look - which I really appreciate. Now if only they rethink that logo mark placementThe Blade is a really nice looking machineMSI tooDo you still have to purchase a separate power adapter?This PC is powerfulAt this pointI mean one drive is significantly cheaper than Google drive for the same storage space.If you buy office 365 you get 1 tb of cloud storageIf you need it office 365 and 1 tbOffice Online is free as well and much better.Office is better than the Google apps but the online versions of the office apps are not.Google's office apps are free either wayYesMicrosoft has Office Online tooExcept practically the entire professional world uses one of them.Are u talking ms office offer or a standalone offering from one drive?about $6 a month for 1 Tb and the office suite. Of course if you only need 100 GB or so others are a good ideaI pay $10 a month for unlimited storage space from Google. I have yet to see a deal better than that (other than a special Amazon was running for a whileI split an O365 family planNot if you've got 5tb of files to store.So that being a fringe caseI have an external drive with duplicate local copies of my entire cloud structure. I like having a backup not located in my house just in case. It's also nice to be able to access my stuff from anywhere in a pinch. It's video and audio archives from my recordings throughout the years and all of my personal stuff like family photos and whatnot. You're getting a hell of a dealYou need a safe deposit box.But how many vhs and polaroids can fit in a safe deposit box?Cortana used to say she likes Siri because they shared a backend search engine.Google Assistant seems to be okay with herI wish one them had some attitude. Me: ""Hey CortanaWill? They've already abandoned it once. They're lapping themselves and aiming at abondoning the same product TWICE. But seriously"
2018-06-09,They just added Unix socket support in the latest release. One can hope :)Given that the UAC window is auto focusedSky net is bornThat was so awesome today.What a UI/UX shit show and total admittance of defeat from Microsoft. Goodness gracious.
2018-06-12,If they put enough resources into allowing UWP apps to be loaded onto the new Band from Android and iPhone it might be interesting.I would give it a little time. I was in the same boat. But it gets better. Just tweak it the best you can. I use both mobile and the web for it.Strange
2018-06-13,"Just another thing they will abandonyeahI stood by then for so many years with the Windows Phone. HopingThat's the issue confidence in buying their consumer tech..... That's a tough sell for me.Pshh . . . I bought the original.Fool me once . . .there are already maaany ways to crash the Windows kernel from user mode programs... no idea why this is newsworthy to highlight a specific method.How so!It is a messYou still go to the website to read your emails?I do quite oftenYou still use email client?Absolutely. And now Cortana is integrated into Outlook 365 I have even less incentive to use web based email interfaces.I love it since the beta :pYesHating on it as well. I lost a long email I was typing to my parents because the keyboard is so sluggish and so it interpreted a space I had typed in the mail as the agreement to delete the mail draft when it popped up a ""leave"" dialog all of a sudden. Terrible step backwardsI have always avoided the website cause the Office Outlook app is amazingI agreeIs there any way to opt out of this new look? What is going on?! I don't have time for this.I agree. GBH to my eyes.Outlook live is beyond terrible now that the beta is live and is the mandatory version. Additional to the anxiety provoking interfaceYou should check out how new Gmail looks like. Outlook is better than Gmail nowGoodIf OneNote doesn't have focusI always thought the Xbox One would be perfect for an office conference room. You could use the Kinect for video conferencing.WellOrI just understood whats going on. I love this app and didn't even notice I had two installed. I'm guessing the 2016 one is part of the office suitesince onestatic which contains lot of useful macros not available for onenote windows 10I'd love to know what they're being used for in enterprise. I follow r/sysadmin and everyone's still complaining about printersPretty sure it’s part of W10 as opposed to the stand alone pod you may be thinking ofAt work we use the long term support version of Windows 10 for Enterprise. As far as I can tellWindows 10 yes"
2018-06-14,How will this affect RDS users who don't have a Windows 10 environment as the OS and uses Office 365 E3 licnesing? I use OneNote extensively and really hope nothing will be changed to where I lose the program
2018-06-16,Really hope the new version runs on multi platforms. We use at the office now on both win 10 and Mac OS
2018-06-20,this is literally the only thing I can imagine that can be super exciting in the tech. industry. I can't wait for an official response from microsoft so we don't stay hanging.What surface phone?Whatever happened with Microsoft's Mixed Reality platform?It's still here? They're still updating it and manufacturers are still selling them. It's also only been like 6 months. What is this article?call me when these things are the size of a pair of reading glasses.They're doing okBTWYou're probably a bot too. Of course that means so am I. It's bots all the way down.Beep boop
2018-06-21,"Hard to kill something that never livedjust put android on it...Nowhere. But sensationalist headlines bring the dollarDidn't even read.Microsoft's literal vision is AINext week: ""Microsoft isn't giving up on Office yet!""Microsoft pivots to Silly Bandz Manufacturing. 'We believe they are the future'lol. ikr?Then “Microsoft still sees a future for cloud computing / A.I.I agree that the title is garbage. Microsoft is all in on mixed reality as the future of computing. There no denying the fact that the MR headsets haven’t exactly taken off like wildfire thoughI'd say they think its the future as much as they thought Kinect was the futureNoNewsflash- most people don't want to wear a computer on their heads.It is really this year where pricing is for headsets & devices with 1050s and above are becoming affordable for consumers to jump into.📅 07/05/2018 ⏰ 16:37 (UTC)On stage at #MSBuild: ""AlexaThis bot is sharing news of a bot talking about a bot.Botception.Nobody likes Siri though"
2018-06-22,With the exception of this article telling us that Microsoft isnt giving up on VR and ARMixed Reality and Kinect are very different. Remember part of Kinect is in the Hololens
2018-06-23,SorryGoogle Drive gives 15gb for freeI recently switched my company from Google Drive to OneDrive For Business. Six months in... the only thing I miss is Apps Script within Google Sheets. OtherwiseSame here. I’ve been an iPhone user for 10 years nowI switched off of One Drive to hosting my own NAS server recently it syncs just like any cloud serviceAll good till you have a floodYou can offsite backup with muliple NAS' units in multiple places. There is a lot of software that allows this.Sure but then your reliant on multiple devicesIf they open up their mobileOS or use a unrestricted version of Windows 10 optimized for phone it may work. They need to make their product distinct and not simply a clone of a locked garden iOS style. Allow people to write apps directly outside of their Windows Store similar to installing a APK in android perhaps. Take a chance 0 percent market share in the mobile OS is unacceptable (IMO)They need to make their product distinct and not simply a clone of a locked garden iOS style.Unlike Android which largely mimicked iOS“But what benefit would this offer to the typical user who is totally content/happy with finding apps in the app store? If such a benefit existsBecause the Windows Store just isn’t very good and has not been well received. Many of the UWP apps don’t offer any new features to the end user and so they are met with a “meh” attitude.This has nothing to do with your recommendation. It has to do with what app developers who deploy to that platform choose to make.The typical user associates Microsoft with being able to run just about anything ... this has always been a major positive associated with Microsoft.It's not that Windows was made to run anythingstill not going to be enoughX64 Windows 10 HomeI would buy a surface phone day one. Just because! I loved using Windows mobileIt won't be called a phone because it will be immediately nailed to the cross next to the iPhone X and Pixel phone and win basically fall flat. Consumer reputation about Windows not having apps on phones killed Windows Phones near the tail end of itWhen I heard of Andromeda I imagined it would be a folding screen device. HoweverThe hardware on this looks stunning
2018-06-24,Samsung is already prepping for Galaxy X next yearI want a surface phone as much as anyone. But it's impossible to kill something that never existed and has been completely fabricated by rumors at this point. Same thing happened with zune phone. Did Microsoft kill it? Or simply the hope that it would happen?I don't think it was a phone. I think it was a two screen tablet that may not be worth the cost with other tech that's happening. I think all of their devices will technically be phones in the near future. I don't think that was a major feature of this tech.But again... All speculation.Yeah
2018-06-25,"That is a weird marketing blind spot then. I wonder if their TOS would let me put a database in it.It has been 3 to 4 years of rumors with no official confirmation. I think people should stop speculating or asking MS to not kill it until it has been announcedThis whole article made me think of all the other ""Microsoft isn't giving up on Windows Mobile yet"" articles I've seen over the years."
2018-06-26,Microsoft needs a space on the mobileOS sector. Making iOS and Android apps is just not going to cut it .. long term. I hope they give a phone another try.
2018-07-03,"I'd love to know to.Sadly due to data we haveI'm guessing this is the accumulation of the times when IT hits the mic button in front of the CxO's in Power BI and says ""and here you can talk to your spreadsheets"".

I'm using it because it's fast and simple but its missing some key featuresHaving seen what they have done with other apps (Skype?)That is because they never integrated Skype into the MS family. For some stupid reason they left Skype to do whatever the fuck they wanted to do. A Mindbogglingly stupid business decision.The windows 10 version still doesn't support page templates among many other things. I don't know what Microsoft is doing. Also can't create section groups: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_onenote-mso_win10-mso_365hp/cant-create-section-groups-in-onenote-for-windows/76192d64-d03e-458b-8b31-1b6de044efa9They recently (finally) allowed you to disable auto-capitalization. This was a huge PITA since I use it for coding notes.I was just listening to Windows Weekly and they said that between now and the end of the summer they are going to add a lot of extra features to OneNote for Windows 10. This is going to alienate people that are stuck on Windows 7How will I now be sure that OneNote had synchronized all notes in all books?Check on the website?Where does it show syncronization status for the OneNote clients?I want all notes to be accessible in situations where I'm not connected to the internet.OHSorry I misunderstood you :) I thought you meant whether it had uploaded your changes yet.YesMan I was hopeful they would make office 2020This is finally the news that I can use to go to my corporate desktop team with and reenable access to the store!...Oh wellUWPHere are a couple of missing features I found that I use:No integration with Outlook Tasks (Microsoft ToDo).

2018-07-04,"Based on the sources of the rumors and corroborating evidenceThe ONLY voice assistant in enterprise... aka companies where IT forgot to disable Cortana on windows 10.Can you tell me what IT task Cortana is good for.Reminders.Imagine a 'remind me when I talk to X again to mention that I saw 'this thing' and that it may help them with their issue... voip systems run on computer*Microsoft's Cortana is the leading voice assistant ... on systems where users cant turn it off.enterprise... by default there is no Cortana......but it is on by default on Win 10 Pro. Which many ""enterprises"" use.And they can still turn it off. I don’t really see your argument here.It's on by default in Enterprise. I make the OS deployments for my enterprise.So it's most used on systems where it does not exist?People can’t use “they forgot to disable it” as an argument. That’s an opinion not fact.The English version of this bot isn't terrible. It's reasonably conversational.The name sounds like XiaomiThe SEC maybe?

2018-07-20,I gave Edge a go and liked it but recently switched back to the Samsung browser only because Edge didn't have ad blockingI'm the same wayIt will be interesting to see if Google enforces their rules about ad blocking technology on items in the Play store.It wouldn't be difficult for Microsoft to implement ad blocking across its entire Windows line up and cut off 1.4 billion users from Google's ad tracking.Not entirely sure Google's investors would welcome such tit-for-tat when upto a fifth of its device reach can in theory be wiped out in one day.This scenario is probably why Google has done nothing in retaliation to Apple for its ad blocking options for their users.Their rules about ad blocking are for apps that tried to interfere with ads in other apps. Browsers blocking ads on web pages are allowed. BraveWhat about iOS users?Don't think the built-in Safari engine supports adding it in. On Android there's nothing restricting them from using whatever browser engine they want. (So they use a Chromium base.)Don't think the built-in Safari engine supports adding it in. On Android there's nothing restricting them from using whatever browser engine they want. (So they use a Chromium base.)Safari supports Content BlockersWhy does Apple do that? At the very least they should allow other web browsing apps to have access to Safari’s built in ad-blocking abilities.I use Purify on iOS which definitely blocks ads..This is why I personally can't stand Apple products. Not nearly enough choice for me.I agreeYeah I totally don't mean to say it's not for anyoneAs a tinkerer I much prefer AndroidGreat news!

Bring in the local biz schools to give them a crash course instead of exMSFT idiots who give out pamphlets and rocks with inspirational messages.I'm including managers in the ""team's performance"" as they're most definitely part of the team. I get it everyone could use more training but there's no ""they took my bonus"" conspiracyOh sorry I wasn't defending that line of thinking. I just meant my anecdotal experience was that I had a manager that I basically coached and got him feedback from other managers about how to do things. ""Managing up"" or whatever.

.......there was a Microsoft pay?
What do you think you're using when you buy apps, movies, games etc. from the Microsoft Store? Microsoft Pay.
It is interesting, but it seems Cortana just passes your query on to Alexa.Also if Alexa doesn't hear you right it just ends and you have to say ""Hey Cortana open Alexa"" again.Hopefully integration will improve. I'm kind of bummed with their lack of general Cortana development. It doesn't even integrate with Microsoft's To Do service yet (though it does have Wunderlist integration even though they announced that Wunderlist will be replaced by To Do a whole year ago). I fear this ""integration"" is really just Microsoft preparing for the day when they tell us Cortana is retired and just use Alexa.
Cortana won't be retired, because it is part of Bing AI which is part of Microsoft Research. Microsoft has over 5,000 people working in AI, Cortana is here to stay.
It's also in the background of many of its applications and services for consumers and enterprises... such as Office.You don't see her, but she is there. Watching. Scheming.
So... Aleana?
I think that’s disappointing on MS’s end. It’s not like Cortana is a sort of host for many other non-MS services or content like Amazon.com or something like the Apple App Store are; I don’t think Microsoft needed to do this and to me, it makes Cortana look bad to have a direct competitor operate alongside it in Alexa, and devalues Cortana as a product. Imagine if a PS4 could play Nintendo Switch cartridges or if you sign up for Verizon phone service but can opt to use AT&T for your LTE. Putting Office and Edge on iOS with apps or doing Minecraft crossplay with Nintendo consoles is a beneficial way to tag team with non-affiliated brands, but this case doesn’t seem to be so. 
it makes Cortana look bad to have a direct competitor operate alongside it in Alexa, and devalues Cortana as a product.On the other hand, you can also ask your Alexa device to talk to Cortana, so that's getting Microsoft into hundreds of thousands/millions of households that they weren't in (at least not since killing the Xbone Kinect).Imagine if a PS4 could play Nintendo Switch cartridges or if you sign up for Verizon phone service but can opt to use AT&T for your LTE. I dunno, those both sound pretty awesome. I'd love for Nintendo to port their games to PC, and to have the option to roam for free/cheap from AT&T to Verizon or T-Mobile in areas where AT&T is weak.IMHO, this isn't terrible but it's not really the integration I wanted to see. Rather than having Cortana stub out to Alexa (or Alexa stubbing out to Cortana), I'd rather see Alexa control of Xbone/Windows 10 devices, possibly mediated by Cortana, such that I could use my Echo as a sort of Kinect-without-video to control them.
If Nintendo porter their 1st party IP games to PC, their console sales would go down and hurt their bottom line (started as a toy company, now sells electronic toys). I suppose Cortana being on Amazon Echo isn’t a bad idea for exposure (no real MS voice device besides a Windows PC and some 3rd party speakers?), but I feel letting Cortana use Alexa devalues it, as it seems like MS is just a middle man to the “real” product. The phone carrier thing would be nice for a consumer, because who cares which you choose (not good for a company that wants you and only you specifically). In summary, I feel MS should try to stand it’s ground with Cortana and work to make it a viable product on its own rather than treat it like a side project and let it couple up with the popular Amazon Alexa (feel MS is doing well with competing in the cloud, but is more passive with other products and should diversify in terms of being competitive).

Amazon's Alexa is very much shopping-focused, though it can do other stuff. Google Home's focusing on the smart home/home automation space. Cortana's sort of a phone assistant on a dead platform, a PC assistant that nobody wants to actually talk to, and an Echo copy but only because Microsoft was able to talk a 3rd party into doing it. It's not really focused on anything that's currently important to Microsoft, which is Cloud and business productivity. Microsoft's not in the shopping space like Amazon, and it's not in the home automation space like Google (Azure IoT is more about collecting telemetry from industrial operations than it is turning your lights on at dusk automatically).The only place so far where Cortana really made sense was in gaming, and Microsoft killed her there by killing the Kinect. They kept the shitty part of Kinect by putting an IR blaster into the S and X consoles, which nobody wanted (it's 2018, implement HDMI-CEC already), when they should have instead put in a mic array to keep voice commands without the unnecessary 3D camera bits of Kinect. Then Cortana, whose name is even derived from a game, would be right at home in a gaming environment.Aside from that, I can't see any reason why anybody would buy a Cortana personal assistant speaker instead of an Echo or Google Home. There's just no value proposition that Microsoft can provide.
Shows how big Amazon is.

If you sign up now for it, you get X-Men days of Future past for free. Tip if it does not show up at first, disconnect the account and reconnect. Worked for me.
It showed up immediately for me without even connecting to Xbox Live, I just connected it to PlayStore and Amazon. I signed up yesterday when the news broke.
Does anyone know how to actually get the movie? I linked my accounts and can't figure out how to get it now.Edit: I figured it out, disconnect your account and reconnect it and it will show up. https://slickdeals.net/f/11906439-movies-anywhere-x-men-days-of-future-past-digital-hd-free-connect-microsoft-movies-tv-account
Try unlinking and then re-link again. Should allow the movie to appear. Also it didn’t work on mobile for me. Had to do it on the desktop website. 
Thanks! I actually edited my comment just now cause I found out that's what worked as you replied.
Do it on desktop. Getting the free movie doesn't work on mobile.
I wish these types of posts always had US Only visible somewhere in the title to save me a click.
At least your comment saved me one.

""Anywhere"" within the USA.What a joke.
Sorry Microsoft doesn't control international copyright law. 
Indeed!
Are TV shows not supported? They didn't link like the movies did.
How have I never known about movies anywhere? Needed this, free movie is just a bonus :) 
Was SO happy about this (Still kinda is) but I just found out today that it's USA only :(

It knows I'm using proxy or VPN. Won't let me register 
Try the VPN named Windscribe and register directly from the app. At least that worked for me... Could you please describe the error you are getting? 
Where's the app? It isn't in Windows 10, Xbox or Android.

Yes
Disconnect it then reconnect it if the movie isn't there.
This could be a game charger for Edge.Might drive the browser's adoption in the enterprise market. 
Not really, this is a standard that's implemented in Chrome and Firefox as well.
Can you me where?
https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/05/webauthnIn general, implementing web standards won't be a ""game changer"" for Edge. It's the minimum that's expected of any modern browser.
Evolutionary in terms of both user experience and security.
This is really cool. Man I would switch in an instant if bookmarks sync was faster
Yes! Why is the bookmark sync so unreliable and slow!?
This is implemented in Chrome and Firefox as well. As long as websites don't use it, you won't be getting any benefit from this API.
Right now, the only thing holding me back from switching is the lack of a macos version, since I work on both Windows and Mac OS
Edge has iOS, Android version, may as well Mac.
It is cool. Now all the major browsers have it. Not sure if they are in production builds yet though. Webauthn.io is a test site you can play with. 
Does Safari?
Not natively, but someone appears to have created an extension for it.
It's pretty sure that web application developers will be quick to implement Web Authentication as a login option, but we'll then be faced with hardware problems. Although more and more PCs and phones are shipped with biometric devices, fingerprint, face, and retina readers are far from ubiquitous. The hardware tokens that act as an alternative cost money which could slow down adoption as well.
Here's hoping Edge even may be able to remember .htaccess passwords. You know, like every other browser out there, even Edge for Android.Edit: Why downvoting? It's a feature that I miss very much, I use Edge as my primary browser. And every other browser can remember such passwords, even IE.
That 'unboxing' video is so satisfying to watch...It's really nice to see that they're thinking about the whole experience for impaired gamers, rather than just the physical controller itself.
Awww... Controller for my teammates.
Controller for my teammates me. 
I'm confused? Wouldnt that be a given since the adaptive controller is essentially for gamers with disabilities?
Scissors are sold in packaging that requires scissors to open. 
What about scissors created specifically for the disabled?
What are you confused about?
Seems like a pointless article tbh.Edit: I see now that the article isn't pointless but that the title was not descriptive enough (judging books by their cover) 
Just because it makes sense doesn't mean that's the way all companies do it. Think of the article like one of those good guy memes. 
That's fine but the title should reflect that them, the title just seems devoid of actual information about what the article is even about (which now that I clicked on it is innovative packaging for disabled people unboxing)
The title is very straight forward, what on earth are you rambling on about. 
I don’t agree that it’s pointless, though the comment about not needing their teeth feels weird to me. However...I think it’s great to focus on what MS is doing here. They’re working hard to try to make gaming accessible to people with disabilities of all kinds. That’s fantastic. This easy-to-open packaging is an element of that and I sure know I wouldn’t have thought anything about the packaging, so I’m really glad I saw this. It may not be for me and it may not change MY life but it sure seems good for those that need it. And the people who will use this and/or the people in their life would be happy to hear this. It’s partially advertising partially just good, positive news.Without their teeth? That sounds weird to me, as I said. But thinking about it from the target market here, I can make sense of it. I don’t want to assume anyone’s struggles here, but I know that with my own functioning hands I still find myself from time to time using my teeth to help me get a spot started on a plastic wrap or something. Now if I didn’t have full use of my hands or something I can only assume I would use my teeth more often. Were that the case and I did that often enough, I know I’d be thrilled to hear that this is something that was thought about.I dunno, just my thought process.
I think it's awesome! But why make an article about the packaging and not the device? Unless there is something revolutionary about their packaging for this product but in that case why not indicate that in the title?? Right??
The device has had plenty of coverage on its own. The package is a beneficial and (by appearances) well-designed. It deserves its own 5 minutes of fame. Especially when it matters and will actually help raise awareness of the product and it’s packaging. I’m sure at least one person who needs it will feel better knowing that the packaging is so friendly for them when it (maybe?) is often overlooked.
After all these comments I decided to read the article. Didn't realize that it was actually revolutionary packaging, l throught OP of this post was talking me for a ride with thier generic title. Don't know why they weren't more specific with their post.
They shared the article. That’s it. They expected you to actually read it. I tend to not read every article and only the headline, but if I’m going to make any judgment or comment at all based on that title then I read the article. There’s often more information that really helps inform you. Sure this isn’t the most important thing for you to be informed on, but the same principle applies to any article.
I don't think you understand. I think the packaging is cool and it should be written about and shared. But like you said a majority of people will read the title. If it isn't a title that's interesting or expressive about what the actual article is about then the awesome packaging won't get any exposure. The only reason I clicked on the article was because of the comments response. Glad I did but your can see why it's easy to judge this book by a cover...
Based on this thread, it's pretty clear that you're the one ""not getting it"". And I'm not talking about headlines vs article content.
We are headed right for a lot more subjectivity that just isn’t worth getting into too much. But here’s my quick take:The title was fine. MAYBE (and it’s a pretty big maybe) it could’ve done with the “without their teeth” part, but like I said, there’s probably much more value to that than I realize. Otherwise I like that the title is to the point and not really clickbaity. That’s what got me to read it, so clearly it did it’s job for me and the several others who clearly read it and liked it (based on comments, sharing, and upvotes.)So sure, maybe I can agree that it was a semi-boring title, but it does the job of telling you what the article is about. It doesn’t need more flair except if you were to compare it to some clickbaity title. It if I saw both i’d actually click the one I felt I could trust to be accurate and set the tone properly. Not the one that’s just trying to draw me into clicks.But that’s me and my own opinion. Commenting on articles, without reading more than the title, is just bad practice though. Same with sharing what you heard. Titles lack the nuance that is necessary to accurately convey the point. Yes they should draw you in, but with all the BS headlines these days I don’t trust them and tend to skip them and find my news elsewhere. Or at the very least I’ll go in ignoring what the title said and focus on the details and make my own judgments.
How do you feel when you open a new gadget that you just bought or received? I feel pretty fucking great. I’d like everyone to experience that feeling. Maybe that’s the point. 
I mean I guess it was just the Reddit title then unless there is anything in there revolutionary (rather not click on a click bait title). But you're completely misinterpreting my point. It is completely obvious that a product made for the disabled would have packaging for the disable the open unassisted. It's like saying Aleve has easy open arthritis lids...
He rode the monopoly position his entire tenure. Under his power they completely missed mobile, allowing a competitor the crown of the most popular operating system on the planet, I dont think there could have been a bigger blunder.Touch screens had already existed as well, it made sense to be prepared with something better than Windows mobile.

Thank you, saved me a click.
Fun fact: Reportedly the original pick from Ballmer was Alan Mulally of Ford Motors Company. But back then Microsoft made a big mistake of announcing Ballmer's departure and the search for the CEO out in the open. All companies with successful CEOs wanted to stop theirs from going to Microsoft. This is said to have played a part in them failing to recruit Mulally and a Qualcomm exec I don't remember. After a few months they had to give in and turn to internal promotion; since then Nadella was always a top pick. Other candidates included Skype lead Tony Bates and Windows lead Terry Myerson, but most of them left the company in the first 2 years of Nadella's tenure, and I think since Myerson left this year none of the candidates are with Microsoft right now. In hindsight, inside or out, Nadella was the best possible pick.
Ballmer missed bad on mobile If he had remained CEO, he would have made the mistake of continuing to put the focus attention and resources towards mobile. His acquisitions were almost all disasters. He also saw open source as the enemy and failed to embrace it. To his credit, he did keep the company very profitable. He resisted the temptation to sell off Xbox and he started Office 365 and laid the early groundwork for the cloud.
My respect for Ballmer is that he also admits he wasn't a great CEO and focused in the wrong areas.
To be fair to Ballmer, a company can do a lot worse than retaining domination over several market sectors with a flat stock price. Obviously growth is better, but it sure beats a downwards slope. At the end of the day, under Ballmer, everyone still got paid.
Though gone are the days of everybody developing solely for Windows, its fallen by the wayside more and more these days, even mobile gaming is getting quite huge with better and better games.The loss of that sheer marketforce could be the start of their ultimate downfall.
Ballmer also was the one that laid the foundation for Azure to be what it is today.
Nadella's work transitioning to open ecosystems, fostering b2b, cloud.. he is turning MSFT into a lean mean working machine. Amazing CEO.
The guy is a genius...his work on collaboration enablement will be legendary in the years to come.
Qualcomm CEO-Steven Mollenkopf, I do remember some nutty speculation that Reed Hastings would be asked lol
Oh yeah thanks for reminding me of two names I totally forgot. Those were the days... But wild rumors aside, the more serious speculations were always Alan Mulally and then Satya Nadella. I remember how Nadella's name came up only after the whole Mulally thing completely fell apart, but the moment people checked his name and career everyone was like ""yeah this guy makes most sense."" Back then we all thought Nadella would be a 'safe' pick, little did we know what an extreme change he would bring to the company...Funny thing, Mulally soon retired from Ford after he refused the Microsoft deal and is now a Google board member.
Yeah it was crazy how wide people were searching. I mostly think Satya is doing a great job, I probably wouldn't have handled Nokia like Microsoft did personally I think they could have subsidized it a bit longer and just focus on a few first part devices, I never thought OEMs would be willing to pay Microsoft like PC makers did. Mulally was good at Ford but it also helped Ford was in trouble, I would hate to have to run Ford now. I didn't realize he was on Google's board, these guys move around to much haha.
I honestly think Mulally was more of the media's choice. People were hyping him up as a turn-around savior, given Ford's performance. Thurrott was in love with the dude and regularly made the case that he was the best choice.
I had heard rumors about Mulally being a top candidate, but if he had gotten the job it would have been a catastrophe, possibly the end of Microsoft. The reason why Microsoft was originally so successful was that it was lead by a technologist. The reason that they foundered under Ballmer is because he was a salesman. He might know the business side but when you're competing in an ever-changing landscape where the rate of change is rapidly increasing, you need someone who understands that landscape and can help navigate it. The only reason they were able to rebound so quickly is due to Nadella's leadership.Now compare them to IBM. Both are tech behemoths. Both have been around for decades. Both were formerly the 800 pound gorilla. Both found themselves behind the 8-ball because they didn't respond quickly enough to the changing landscape. The big difference is who they have leading their company. Rometty eventually got IBM turned around (analysts think, because of three successive quarters of revenue growth), but it took 6 years to do it, during which IBM shrunk from a company with over $100 billion in annual revenue to a company with a little over $80 billion in annual revenue. Sure, she was an engineer for her first 10 years at IBM, but in 1991 jumped into sales and management and never looked back.You just can't afford to have someone running your massive tech company that doesn't come from a tech background these days. It's far too risky.
Steve Jobs
What about him? He was one of the founders and visionaries behind Apple, the founder of NeXT (both deeply technical roles) and more or less the saviour of Pixar back when they were a hardware company looking for investors rather than a film studio. He had a tremendous amount of experience in the computer hardware industry before he came back to Apple. So for someone to say that he was not technical (which is the only thing I can infer from your not-even-a-sentence-fragment-much-less-an-articulated-argument comment) is patently absurd.
I remember the logic back then and it still makes sense in the contemporary perspective. While not exactly IT, he was the example of an engineer CEO that did amazing jobs with Boeing and then Ford. His Ford background gave him a bit of a relationship with Microsoft and Boeing one obviously meant Seattle connections as well.The biggest minus people were talking about, which I still think was absolutely right, was that he is from outside of both IT and Microsoft, so he would have needed a learning time. He is now at a Google board so he knows the space as well, but one of the key advantages for Nadella was that he knew the company back to back and could make big choices very fast. Weeks into his tenure Nadella approved Office for IPad. That would have taken some more time with Mulally.
I would say Terry Myerson would have been a good pick as well. He would have pushed more for mobile and I think still does. I really wish Microsoft would release a phone once a year. It would be nice for them to present something. Joe Belfiore is another top Microsoft executive that is now in charge of Windows in general and... I don't know about that. A lot of what he has presented on stage has been lackluster features like Timeline, Sets, and the Photos app. Timeline is decent feature, but with Virtual Desktops just implemented feels like it is getting in the way. If it aggregated what the user does by files as opposed to applications I think I'd like it more. Sets seems like it's there to push Microsoft Edge more than add something to the user interface. And the Photos app... Almost every part of the Photos app seems poorly designed. I've stopped using it. The image layout, the button layout, the ""Ads"" inside the app, all seem to be poorly placed. I think part of the problem with Microsoft is they try to be better than their audience when a lot of people on Reddit have been asking for certain things that still haven't been implemented or are just now being implemented. Mainly, a consistent UI. Not even a ""beautiful UI"" just a consistency between all elements. Sometimes, it seems like the user interface is ""design by committee"" and that is why there isn't a consistency. Sometimes, it's a question of poor design choice like the original ""pill"" toggle. Link.
Terry Myerson would have been a good pickthat's a pretty big No from me, not that my opinion matters at all.
I heard he was a difficult manager as well, so I understand if anyone didn't want him to have the position. I think he's nicer than he used to be, if that counts.
Anyone but Terryble.
Myerson is polarizing at best imo, his general direction for Windows 10 was right but there were so many things that could have been better with the general direction of it. The fact that Windows Insiders are rather quite content with the new direction of RS5 that emphasizes polish over new features speaks volumes. He tried to push for too many things just to have Windows stay new and relevant. With him as a CEO Microsoft would have wanted to continue with ""Windows first"" mantra.
Nadella has done a great job recovering MS from Ballmer's many failures.
From what I understand it's all about the backend.To-Do is rebuilt on Office 365. That's the key for Microsoft. It's also why it's taken so long for the app to start getting new features regularly - they've been spending time reinventing Wunderlist on O365 because Office, enterprise, cloud, compliance... You get the picture, I hope.There was an article in the Verge about this recently and why only recently To-Do client started getting major new features. Haven't got the link right now but I encourage you to read.(edit, 9 days late) -> https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17146308/microsoft-wunderlist-to-do-app-acquisition-complicatedTl;Dr Wunderlist is great product, but not an O365 product.
Thankfully Wunderlist still works!
Barely limping along. I switched to Todoist. It's great.
What features made you switch? I can't think of anything Wunderlist misses for me at the moment. 
I abandoned Wunderlist the day that I found out about the acquisition, and it wasn't because there were features I wanted that it didn't have (although 2Do does have a few nice features that Wunderlist didn't), it's because I couldn't trust it any more. I couldn't use a task-management system with the threat hanging over me that it would one day suddenly disappear or change radically, and having been in on the Testflight (without realizing that there was the acquisition going on), I knew that I hated the kill-it-with-fire new version.I still use 2Do for the part of my life that lives in GTD-land, but over the last six months I've found that most things have migrated into Trello and Reminders. Wunderlist was the perfect tool at the perfect time, I think it's sad that they screwed it up, but I've moved on.
Ive been having a lot of syncing issues with Wunderlist lately, and frequent loss of data its been frustrating. I decided to jump ship over To-Do. It does take some getting used to, but at this point I can really only see two features that are missing - I wish the My Day page tasks were grouped in a similar way that Wunderlist used (clear headings, rather than in-line list names) and auto-populating My Day. Once these are implemented I see no difference any more, at least in the way I use it - which is fairly obsessively.I like the direction its headed, its clean, modern and very responsive. Wunderlist is looking dated IMO when I go back to it.As well - it seems like the back-end stuff has been tackled as there have been a lot of cosmetic changes and much more frequent user-facing development as of late - dark theme, subtasks. The repeating tasks feature is far superior to Wunderlist at this point. I'm using the beta on my android and it has priority stars finally, so thats nice.Edit:Check out the uservoice forum to see whats in the pipeline: https://todo.uservoice.com/
Thanks for the UserVoice link. I just voted on a new suggestion ""Auto-Add to My Day Until Complete"" and a similar, highly-visible suggestion already under review. Both would fill another missing feature I'd like to see in To-Do.
They recently added few features (sync with Outlook tasks, group of tasks...), but clearly this product is not getting much love.To-do and Planner are kinda overlapping too, and the later is getting more development effort.My idea is that to-do should not exist, and personal tasks should be handled in Planner. I don't really see why we should have 2 products for task management, especially when the 2 products still need a lot of improvements.
They are very different in approach. One is kanban board, second is plain list. One is focused on progression, second on done / not done state. They can't be merged and kept in a state that pleases both audiences. Planner is better for teams working on a project, ToDo is better for simple, quick lists - shopping, chores etc. 
Microsoft's plan is to integrate To-Do will all of it's planning/task apps. They are aware there are 5 overlapping applications. To-Do is supposed to be the one stop shop for all tasks due.Here's a long Ignite Video explaining some of that (and where I got the screenshot).
Listen to this guy. Answers all questions. 
Ok well... Hopefully they are aware of their own mess... But it's a vision... Almost a year now from the last Ignite and not much changed. To-do is still not even ""enterprise"" compliant.I can understand that they want to make to-do the hub for tasks... But when you look at To-do and Planner... You wonder why, Planner seems way more polished at this point.Also they had many goals and vision before that just fade in time... OneDrive was supposed to be the go to place for all things files and share... I don't think it's happening, and I think they have enough telemetry to know that end users are not really spending much time in OneDrive web app.Let's see how things will go, and we might know more at next Ignite... But for me, even personal tasks management should be possible in Planner/Teams.
Because Wunderlist uses AWS, which as you can imagine Microsoft wants to put an end to.
for a company like microsoft, migrating from aws to azure is almost trivial
The Wunderlist team however are the ones doing the migration and recoding their entire application to use it, along with migrating over to UWP.
Cortana's grocery list is powered by Wunderlist, right? I recently downloaded that app because it was far too many steps to get to the grocery list through Cortana.
Along those lines, Microsoft Launcher also doesn't show calendar info from their Outlook app. 
I agree and told the To-do PMs on Twitter the same thing. For me, the lack of Cortana and Microsoft Launcher integration made me switch back to Wunderlist after being on To-Do for several months.
I agree the lack of Microsoft launcher integration is silly. Cortana integration probably can't come until late development (now maybe) so as not to break links.But you can add custom widgets to the Microsoft launcher feed, and the ToDo widget looks fairly nice imo.To Do widget in feed
I thought the same as OP, but recently found that To-Do supports list sharing between accounts AND subtasks AND stars on important items. So, serious question, what more does it need to fully replace Wunderlist today?The only thing I miss right now is dark mode, and that's just a silly discrepancy between the Windows app and the mobile app.
If MS were serious, they'd have deactivated Wunderlist and deleted it from the app store. 
that's how other companies like paypal works. Acquiring companies just for shutting them down. (I'm still pissed for how quickly they killed stackmob)
Yes, if they were serious about infuriating millions of users, they would have removed a beloved app immediately before it's replacement was even close to being ready. Thank goodness they weren't serious about doing that.
No shit Sherlock, you can only gut your app ecosystem so many times before developers say it ain’t worth the hassle.
Um, no flipping duh...? IMO, they need to pull way the hell back and aim for making a device that integrates with their ecosystem, does a few things REALLY well, and carve out a niche. They can get to third party apps later. I think a good example of a product that doesn't get enough analysis regarding app ecosystems is the Apple Watch: The thing had a pre-install base and developers flocked to it at launch, but ultimately no one cared. I'm not saying people don't like the product and that it doesn't sell well, but people don't want a device that does everything ""okMore like he's using Microsoft to validate his own work?Personally I just want to see the license for the source code.If it's ""linux"" but not very open sourceYes that is sales"

2018-08-12,By my count that now makes 3 former Crystal Dynamics names. They're part of the team responsible for some of the past Tomb Raider gamesCan't wait for that single player gameYeah
2018-08-14,It's good to see these cloud focused companies are working together on commonThe bigger issue to me seems that the US doesn't impose any meaningful fines on tech companies for consistently violating our trust on an almost daily basis. This to me suggests the death of privacy will be by a thousand cuts.Google clearly cant be trusted.NahHow about they make that pledge about all of my data? Cause that's the only way I'm going to keep putting it in your hands to whatever degree I can help it.
2018-08-15,It was my impression that was coming with 15.8 as well. I'm installing it nowI searched the release notes for preview 1 . It wasn't there too. It was mentioned in a separate blog post.I wouldn't trust a word Alphabet says. They will sell your health data the first opportunity they get.If you're proud of the product and think that when consumers touch and use they will fall in love with it then do it. At least come out with dev unit to see what the potential could be. Now it seems if it doesn't come out this year it's because it's just not ready not just OS issues but hardware issues as well.He's right. The easiest attack vector is the lazy admin. AlsoSureI suppose I would set my password to something stronger than “password”I mean when I see it I think about it really honestly. Everyone wants more moneyMsft employee hereThe way these questions are wordedThe Microsoft Poll happens every year and these numbers are shared widely. Anyone could have forwarded them to CNBC
2018-08-16,The security of azure or aws will be more than likely stronger than if you roll your own though...?less people with logins to itthats the problem thoughI think it’s an issue of you understanding how cloud services workI suspect many read that poll question as “do you want more money?”
2018-08-17,"This is cyclical. They try to pay at something like 75th market percentile. Sometimes they fall back a bit and have to fix it. If it's bad enough they even give it a fancy nameIn general that's how discussions of Poll end up with managers dismissing this question as ""people always want more money"". However with time I believe lots of people are getting more information on competitor salaries- where Google"
2018-08-19,The latest “challenge” is called the Momo Suicide Game
2018-08-21,Not to sound insensitive but why?If someone can signHi Bipartisan:Thanks for the question. 😉 Perhaps you missed the reasoning in the text. But here again is the reasoning👍🏿.Think about the move of technology toward ambient voice navigated computing such as Amazon's Alexa and Google Home. People who do not speak are currently excluded from that scenario which is on course to becoming more of a normalized means of our personal computing experience. Integrating sign language includes them in this computing evolution.It's all about the consistency and the breadth of Microsoft's inclusive design mission. Their stated goal is to design thier products from conception forward with all users in mind. ThisThat's a very good perspective. I haven't really thought about how leaving users out of the voice assistant wave IS exclusive. Thanks for that.Given that the vast majority of people who use sign language are deaf as well as muteTechnically no because these devices don't have screens either so you can't see what you are typing. Which leads to my other objection below.It's about designing new devices or add-ons that are more inclusiveThe new voice & audio devices address a very real problem for those who are visually impaired.This new idea helps who?It's not about thatHands free? UmDid you read the article?You mean the one full of pandering and over-promised technology. Sure. I especially liked the part where the ALS speaker is perfectly framed while standing
2018-08-27,I can't believe they are now acquiring theories.
2018-08-28,why was this posted? article is from 2013
2018-08-29,Thumbnail looks like the guy had his eyes ripped out.Ok glad I wasn’t the only one thinking thatThose glasses are awfulSounds in MS' platforms are really good. Design is not an easy task. You have to know your instruments (virtual usually) and psychoacoustics.I'm using a Samsung 'cause my 950 died. Android sounds are horrendous.I'm still using the Windows Phone sounds on my Android (where possible) for that very reason.Hey I'll do that. Thx!You can find them on XDACoolas a person who has studied both music and psychologyThis is really beautifulGreat video. Really enjoyed it.So much work for an alert sound and so little (none) for the dark theme on new/edit calendar event screen.yeah it's almost as if sound design isn't responsible for that kind of thingIdk I had the feeling that the Outlook team was responsible for both.Are you 12 or is the concept of expertise and task-assignment too complicated for you?I'm a bit older than thatMy guy
2018-08-30,They are fucking awful.The guy knows what he's talking about and clearly does great work but those glasses are pretentious as hell.I guess with 0 knowledge about a topic you can still play the moral high ground card.That should be fineIf you think blaming the sound designer for your poor experience in using the UII'm not blaming the sound designer. How can you call anyone stupid when you can't even read? Oh fuck it. I'm wasting my fucking time.You're wasting everyone's time.That's kinda obvious thoughLet's not assume that everyone is a moron.And why should we... you are the only moron.
2018-08-31,Awesome! But it's still a yearly subscriptionStill perpetual licensing exists.Sounds like you have just one license. There is personalIn 20 yearsit's cheaper than what you will payThat's all relative. From your perspective sure. Maybe you don't need cloud storage. All of us do. All those plans are $5/month at a minimum for our requirementsWhat are you storing that takes up that much data? If you are a video CreatorIt cost less than 1 year of 365 and will work for a lifetime..How do you figure? O365 Personal is only $70/year. I've never seen the full suite legally available for less than that. And that's before you look at O365 add-ins like the 1TB of OneDrive space. That's cheaper than you can get the storage alone via Dropbox
2018-09-01,Well yeah if it's UWP of course it'll work on S..*Not for outside of the US
2018-09-02,First interview is pretty easy (why MS? Azure competitorsCurrent MACH here. Agreed with the above that the first round questions are pretty standard interview questions. The second round is where you’ll want to study up on MSFT products and it’ll be more technical/specific depending on the role. Best of luck on the interview! You’re going to do great!Thanks!!Why did you decide to choose the MACH program btw?Just like Cortana...Yeah sortaUWP Alexa can't be that hard of a deliverable.
2018-09-03,If we’re being candidminute details like this​In previous versions of WindowsThat's OS design flaws then not Sound design flaws. Sometimes working on the inside you don't really see what users benefit from. If anything just put quiet mode on your pc and it will stop all notifications.
2018-09-04,Just run up a KMS serverThathe's annoying
2018-09-05,"And it would still require that the PC have a valid Windows license before upgrading to Enterprise via. KMS as KMS keys are only ""upgrades"". It's woeful how even after Linus makes an attempt to appear legitimate it's still not even legitimate. The best option for him are Windows RETAIL licenses which are fully transferable."
2018-09-12,Go Microsoft!Go patch them Vulns!Would these be patched in the RS5 Insider Previews?no 'patching' in RS5 fast ring
2018-09-13,why are you r/news mods banning long time users now from a major subreddit? What's the goal here?
2018-09-14,Even Apple and Google change UI paradigms every few years and Apple at least got it right very early
2018-09-17,In other news - 200 Microsoft jobs to be cut elsewhere in Europe. Same shit as last year.The main issue is building a good App Store from scratch. A more likely outcome is continuing their trend of building great Microsoft 365 integration on Android and IOS. Possibly a Signature Edition phone partnership.If they updated their launcher to look like WP8 I would be sooooo happy l. My windows phone version of the M8 was my favorite phone I ever had :(Are there not 3rd party apps that can somewhat replicate the launcher? I have an iPhone nowAs long as it runs WP8 I’d be downOr even WM1 (Windows Mobile 1)?I think the time is rightHeyRecruiter reached out on LinkedIn and said I should apply. then a week later I got an email to set up a 30 min phone interviewHello fellow redditor!I actually interviewed Aug 31st as well.
